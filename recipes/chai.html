    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Masala chai, also known simply as chai, is an Indian beverage popular throughout South Asia. Chai is made by brewing black tea in milk and water and then sweetening with sugar</p>

    <p>While some variants may also include the addition of aromatic herbs and spices, known colloquially as Masala chai, the most common preparation is unspiced</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Tea leaves</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Ginger</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 2 cups water in a vessel or pan. When the water becomes hot, then add 2 to 3 tablespoons of sugar or according to taste.</li>
        <li>Now add the grated or minced ginger. You can also crush the ginger and then add it. Choose to add less ginger if you want.</li>
        <li>Simmer for 2 to 3 minutes on a medium heat.</li>
        <li>Boil for 1 to 2 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Add 2 teaspoons of Assam tea powder or black tea powder. The tea used to make chai is in the form of granules and we call them tea powder.

            Assam tea makes for a strong brew. For a lighter brew add Darjeeling tea powder or your preferred tea.
            
            </li>
        <li>Boil the tea on a medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes or as needed. For a more stronger tea, you can boil for some more minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour ¼ to ½ cup of milk. If you like strong tea then add ¼ cup of milk. If you like more milk then add ½ cup.</li>
        <li>Switch off the heat, strain the tea onto a mesh strainer kept above the serving glasses or cups.</li>
        <li>Serve the cutting chai hot along with some tea time snacks like nankhatai, pakora or samosa or murukku or sandwich or biscuits.</li>
    </ol>
